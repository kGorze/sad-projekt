# Correlation Analysis Module
# Functions for analyzing correlations within and between groups
# Supports different correlation methods based on data characteristics

# Main correlation analysis function
perform_correlation_analysis <- function(data, group_column, variables) {
  # TODO: Implement correlation analysis
  # - Calculate correlations within each group
  # - Determine appropriate correlation method (Pearson, Spearman)
  # - Test for statistical significance
  # - Report correlation strength and direction
}

# Pearson correlation for continuous variables
calculate_pearson_correlation <- function(data, variables, groups) {
  # TODO: Implement Pearson correlation
  # - For normally distributed continuous variables
  # - Calculate correlation matrix
  # - Test for significance
  # - Handle missing data
}

# Spearman correlation for ordinal/non-normal data
calculate_spearman_correlation <- function(data, variables, groups) {
  # TODO: Implement Spearman correlation
  # - Non-parametric correlation
  # - Suitable for ordinal data or non-normal distributions
  # - Rank-based correlation analysis
}

# Correlation within specific groups
analyze_group_correlations <- function(data, group_name, variables) {
  # TODO: Implement group-specific correlation analysis
  # - Filter data for specific group
  # - Calculate correlations within group
  # - Compare correlation patterns between groups
}

# Interpretation of correlation strength
interpret_correlation_strength <- function(correlation_value) {
  # TODO: Implement correlation interpretation
  # - Classify correlation strength (weak, moderate, strong)
  # - Provide interpretation guidelines
  # - Consider practical significance vs statistical significance
